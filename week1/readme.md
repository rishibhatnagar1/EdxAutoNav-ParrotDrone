This is the answer to the challenge, we were required to touch all the beacons, just wanted to find out the shortest way in which I could do that.Hence this.
From what I think, 6 steps looks like the best way of covering all the beacons, but I am guessing there should be a better way of doing this. If you know of a shorter way of covering all the beacons, please let me know. :)
